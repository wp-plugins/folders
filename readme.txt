Bulk organise your media attachments, custom post types, pages and posts into folders. A perfect addition to sites with large amounts of pages, posts or media attachments.

== Description ==

Folders gives you the ability to better organise the back-end of your WordPress site by allowing you to add pages, posts and media attachments into folders. You can then filter your pages, posts and media by the folder they belong to from within the admin sidebar. A handy plugin for those with lots of pages or posts and a whole of media.
