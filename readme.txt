Organise your media attachments, custom post types, pages and posts into folders. Perfect for large amounts of pages, posts and media attachments.

== Description ==

Folders gives you the ability to better organise the back-end of your WordPress site by allowing you to add pages, posts and media attachments into folders. You can then filter your pages, posts and media by the folder they belong to from within the admin sidebar. A handy plugin for those with lots of pages or posts and masses of media.

Check out a run down of the Folders plugin in use with media attachments. (Thanks to James Olsen for this great video).
